# Now deployed to [Scrap Cats Streamlit](https://scrap-cats.streamlit.app/)
# Meet the contenders 
## 1. Authentic Idiocy, the A.I. Detection
A convolutional neural net that has seen its share of DALLE-2 and Midjourney art, and had enough (like I've, for now).

Built from scraps found in the CIFAKE database, which explains why it's endowed with ocular degeneration of every extant sort. (Train Image Size = 48px)

Test Data Accuracy: 94%

## 2. ResNetFifty, Style and AI classifier
A transfer-taught Residual Network 50. Microsoft's fifty layer deep CNN. Uses skip connections to eliminate *vanishing gradients*, which otherwise makes excruciating the optimization of deeper, complexer networks. 

Also classifies style, under: "impressionism", "renaissance", "surrealism", "art_nouveau", "baroque", "expressionism", "romanticism", "ukiyo_e", "post_impressionism", "realism". Google those.

Trained on the lovely AI-ArtBench Dataset. (Train Image Size = 128px)

Test Data Accuracy: 96%

## 3. NSFW Classifier
The nsfw-detector module frequently runs out of breath keeping up with Keras and TF's rapid versioning. Removing this for now, until a stabler option is found.
Improvements planned: Incorporate the [NudeNet database](https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1)
